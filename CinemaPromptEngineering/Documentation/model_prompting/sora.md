# Sora Prompting Guide

Category: Video

## Official Guidance Highlights
- Be specific, then iterate: start with core intent, add camera, motion, and pacing.
- Describe timing and shot beats if needed.
- Fewer moving parts improves fidelity and physics.
- You can add camera and motion directions, look and pacing, and audio intent.

## Recommended Prompt Structure
1. Subject + setting (who/what, where, time of day)
2. Camera and motion (shot type, movement)
3. Look and pacing (style, rhythm)
4. Audio intent (optional)

## Positive Examples
- "Wide establishing shot of a foggy bridge at dawn, slow dolly left, cool palette, soft ambience of wind and distant traffic."
- "Close-up of a barista pouring latte art, shallow depth of field, warm cafe light, soft clinking cups."

## Negative Examples (What to Avoid)
- "No wind, no noise, no movement" (replace with desired sound and motion)
- "Ten characters running, talking, and dancing" (too many moving parts)

## Notes
- Use Remix to branch versions instead of overwriting successful prompts.
