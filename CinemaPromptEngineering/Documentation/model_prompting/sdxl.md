# Stable Diffusion XL Prompting Guide

Category: Image

## Official Guidance Highlights
- No dedicated SDXL prompt guide was found in official docs.
- Use clear natural language and the same structured approach recommended for SD3.5.

## Recommended Prompt Structure (SD3.5-style)
1. Style or medium
2. Subject + action
3. Composition and framing
4. Lighting and color
5. Technical cues (camera, lens, viewpoint)
6. Optional text in quotes

## Positive Examples
- "Photography, candid street photo of a cyclist in light rain, reflective pavement, shallow depth of field, cool tones."
- "Illustration, cozy reading nook, warm lamp light, soft shadows, muted palette."

## Negative Examples (What to Avoid)
- "Best quality, amazing, masterpiece" (non-visual adjectives only)
- "Photo, watercolor, oil" (conflicting styles)

## Notes
- Keep prompts concise and front-load the most important elements.
- If text is required, quote it and describe placement.
