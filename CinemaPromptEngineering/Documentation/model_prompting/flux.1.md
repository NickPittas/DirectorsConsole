# FLUX.1 Prompting Guide

Category: Image

## Official Guidance Highlights
- Use the framework: Subject + Action + Style + Context.
- Word order matters: lead with the most important elements.
- Expand with layers: visual, technical, atmospheric.
- Prefer positive prompts over negatives (describe what should be there).
- For text in images, use quotes and specify placement and style.

## Recommended Prompt Structure
1. Subject + action
2. Style (photo, illustration, etc.)
3. Context (setting, time, lighting)
4. Visual layer (color, composition)
5. Technical layer (lens, DOF)
6. Atmospheric layer (mood, story)

## Positive Examples
- "Red fox sitting in tall grass, wildlife documentary photography, misty dawn, soft rim light, shallow depth of field"
- "Studio product shot of a matte black watch, clean white background, crisp highlights, 85mm lens, editorial lighting"
- "A storefront with a neon sign reading "OPEN", red neon letters above the door, rainy street reflections"

## Negative Examples (What to Avoid)
- "No crowds, no fog, no signs" (replace with a positive scene description)
- "Beautiful, amazing, stunning" (vague adjectives without visual anchors)
- "A city, a forest, a beach, a spaceship" (unfocused multi-scene prompts)

## Notes
- Short (10-30 words) for exploration; medium (30-80) for control; long (80+) for complex scenes.
- If text must be legible, include exact wording in quotes and describe font style.
