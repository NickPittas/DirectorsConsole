# MiniMax Video Prompting Guide

Category: Video

## Official Guidance Highlights
- Follow the guide structure: subject, action, camera, environment.
- Keep prompts compact and single-scene.
- Use clear camera cues to control motion.

## Prompt Anatomy (Recommended)
1. Subject
2. Action
3. Camera framing + motion
4. Environment + lighting

## Do This
- State a single action with a simple camera move.
- Use short, concrete phrases.
- Keep one location and consistent time.

## Avoid This
- Vague actions ("doing something interesting").
- Multi-scene descriptions.
- Long lists of unrelated details.

## Positive Examples
```text
Medium shot of a cyclist crossing a bridge; the camera tracks alongside; golden hour light.
```
```text
Close-up of a watchmaker's hands; the camera holds steady; soft desk lamp light.
```
```text
Wide shot of a coastal road; the camera slowly pans right as a car passes; bright midday sun.
```

## Negative Examples (What to Avoid)
- "A city, a forest, and space" (multiple scenes)
- "Amazing cinematic vibe" (no concrete details)
- "Pan left, tilt up, zoom in, orbit" (too many camera moves)
