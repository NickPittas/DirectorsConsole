# Generic Prompting Guide

Category: General

## Best Practices
- Lead with the subject and action, then add scene, lighting, and style.
- Use concrete visual details (materials, colors, lighting direction).
- Keep the prompt focused on one scene.
- Quote any required text and describe placement.

## Recommended Prompt Structure
1. Subject + action
2. Scene and setting
3. Lighting and mood
4. Style or medium
5. Composition and camera
6. Text in quotes (optional)

## Positive Examples
- "A lone hiker on a ridge at sunrise, warm rim light, thin mist, wide cinematic framing, soft film grain."
- "A cookbook cover with the title "SEASONAL" centered, serif type, warm kitchen background."

## Negative Examples (What to Avoid)
- "Make it nice" (vague)
- "A city, a forest, a beach" (multiple unrelated scenes)
