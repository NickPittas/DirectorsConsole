# Veo 3 Prompting Guide

Category: Video

## Official Guidance Highlights
- Start with strong character and world details.
- Use sensory language for texture, atmosphere, and light.
- Define style and tone explicitly (realistic, stop-motion, etc.).
- Add audio cues if you want synchronized sound.

## Recommended Prompt Structure
1. Style and tone
2. Subject details + action
3. Environment and atmosphere
4. Camera framing and motion
5. Audio cues (optional)

## Positive Examples
- "Stop-motion style, a camper says "I'm one with nature now", a bear replies, soft forest ambience, medium shot."
- "Cinematic: a paper boat sails in a rain-filled gutter, macro shot, wet reflections, quiet rain sound."

## Negative Examples (What to Avoid)
- "Epic and cool" (no concrete visual anchors)
- "Lots of stuff happens" (unclear action)
