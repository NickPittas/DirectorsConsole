# Hunyuan Video Prompting Guide

Category: Video

## Official Guidance Highlights
- Follow the handbook structure: subject, scene, motion, camera, lighting.
- Include shot type and lens feel to stabilize framing.
- Describe motion as change over time, not a still image.

## Prompt Anatomy (Recommended)
1. Subject + action
2. Scene + time of day
3. Camera framing + lens feel
4. Motion (subject and/or camera)
5. Lighting or mood

## Do This
- Use clear shot terms (wide/medium/close-up).
- Keep one primary motion at a time.
- Use tangible lighting cues (backlit, soft overcast, neon).

## Avoid This
- Multiple camera moves stacked together.
- Equipment callouts ("shot on X camera").
- Abstract adjectives without visual anchors.

## Positive Examples
```text
Close-up of raindrops on a leaf; soft overcast light; the focus slowly shifts from foreground to background.
```
```text
Wide shot of a quiet street at dawn; a cyclist passes; the camera pans right at a gentle pace, cool blue light.
```
```text
Medium shot of a chef plating food; warm kitchen light; subtle handheld motion, slow tempo.
```

## Negative Examples (What to Avoid)
- "Shot on a RED, anamorphic, 8K" (equipment callouts)
- "Pan left, tilt up, zoom in, then orbit" (too many moves)
- "Beautiful and cinematic" (no concrete detail)
