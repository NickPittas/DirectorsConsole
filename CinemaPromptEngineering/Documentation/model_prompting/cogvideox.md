# CogVideoX Prompting Guide

Category: Video

## Official Guidance Highlights
- No dedicated prompt guide is published in the repo; use standard video prompting best practices.
- Keep prompts short and focused on one visible action.
- Describe motion clearly over time.

## Prompt Anatomy (Recommended)
1. Subject + action
2. Scene + time of day
3. Camera framing + motion
4. Style or mood

## Do This
- Keep one action beat and a single camera move.
- Use concrete visual descriptors (lighting, material, weather).
- Describe the temporal change ("the view tracks as...").

## Avoid This
- Multiple scene transitions in a single prompt.
- Lists of adjectives with no motion.
- Crowding many subjects into a short clip.

## Positive Examples
```text
A cat leaps onto a windowsill; the camera follows with a gentle handheld sway, afternoon light.
```
```text
Wide shot of a small boat on a calm lake; slow push-in as ripples spread, soft golden hour light.
```
```text
Medium shot of a skateboarder rolling past a mural; the camera tracks alongside at a steady pace.
```

## Negative Examples (What to Avoid)
- "A city, then a jungle, then space" (multiple scene changes)
- "Gorgeous, stunning, cinematic" (no motion or subject)
- "Ten people doing different things" (too many subjects)
