# Wan 2.2 Prompting Guide

Category: Video

## Official Guidance Highlights
- Use a structured prompt: opening shot, camera motion, reveal.
- Call out direction and pace for the camera move.
- Keep subject actions simple and visible.

## Prompt Anatomy (Recommended)
1. Opening shot + scene
2. Camera motion + pace
3. Reveal or key action
4. Lighting or mood

## Do This
- Use short, declarative sentences.
- Keep a single reveal or action beat.
- Prefer positive descriptions over negations.

## Avoid This
- Stacking multiple effects at once.
- Switching locations mid-clip.
- Overloading with adjectives.

## Positive Examples
```text
Opening: empty alley at night. Camera: slow push-in. Reveal: a neon sign flickers to life.
```
```text
Opening: quiet diner at dawn. Camera: gentle pan right. Reveal: a waitress pours coffee, steam rising.
```
```text
Opening: foggy bridge at sunrise. Camera: slow tracking shot. Reveal: a cyclist emerges from the mist.
```

## Negative Examples (What to Avoid)
- "Open in a forest, then cut to a city" (location change)
- "Make it cinematic and epic" (no concrete detail)
- "Push-in, tilt up, orbit, zoom" (too many moves)
