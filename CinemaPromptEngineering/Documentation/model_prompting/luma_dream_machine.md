# Luma Dream Machine Prompting Guide

Category: Video

## Official Guidance Highlights
- Use natural language and describe the scene as if briefing a collaborator.
- Favor positive description; reserve negatives for specific exclusions.
- Call out camera motion and subject motion explicitly.
- Keep the prompt concise and focused on one moment.

## Prompt Anatomy (Recommended)
1. Subject + action
2. Scene + time of day
3. Camera framing + motion
4. Style or mood

## Do This
- Keep one location and a single action beat.
- Name the camera move (push-in, pan, tracking) and pace.
- Describe motion over time, not just a still image.

## Avoid This
- Multiple scene changes inside one prompt.
- Abstract adjectives without concrete visuals.
- Long lists of unrelated details.

## Positive Examples
```text
Wide shot of a quiet beach at dusk; the camera slowly pans left as wind moves the grass, warm pastel sky.
```
```text
Close-up of a ceramic mug on a windowsill; slow push-in as steam curls upward, soft morning light.
```
```text
Medium shot of a cyclist on a forest trail; the camera tracks alongside at a steady pace, dappled sunlight.
```

## Negative Examples (What to Avoid)
- "A forest, a city, then a desert, cinematic" (multiple scene changes)
- "Beautiful, amazing, epic" (no concrete visual content)
- "Make it like a movie" (no camera or motion detail)
