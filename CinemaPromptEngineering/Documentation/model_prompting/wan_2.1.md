# Wan 2.1 Prompting Guide

Category: Video

## Official Guidance Highlights
- No official prompt guide was available; use a tight, structured prompt.
- Keep a single action and a single camera move.
- Describe motion and pacing explicitly.

## Prompt Anatomy (Recommended)
1. Opening shot + scene
2. Subject action
3. Camera motion + pace
4. Lighting or mood

## Do This
- Start with an opening shot and environment.
- Specify the direction and speed of the camera move.
- Use concrete visual language (weather, time, materials).

## Avoid This
- Multiple locations or time jumps.
- Vague adjectives without visuals.
- Overly long prompts with many clauses.

## Positive Examples
```text
Opening wide shot of a snowy street; the camera glides forward as a cyclist passes, soft blue light.
```
```text
Medium shot of a street musician; slow push-in as the crowd gathers, warm evening light.
```
```text
Close-up of a candle flame; the camera holds steady as the flame flickers, dark room.
```

## Negative Examples (What to Avoid)
- "A city, then a forest, then a beach" (multiple scene changes)
- "Amazing, cinematic, epic" (no concrete visuals)
- "Pan left, tilt up, zoom in, orbit" (too many moves)
