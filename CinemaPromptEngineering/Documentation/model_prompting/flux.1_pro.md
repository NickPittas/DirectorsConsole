# FLUX.1 Pro Prompting Guide

Category: Image

## Official Guidance Highlights
- Use Subject + Action + Style + Context as the base.
- Front-load critical elements for stronger adherence.
- Add visual, technical, and atmospheric layers for precision.
- Prefer positive prompts; avoid negative lists.
- Quote exact text and describe placement if typography is required.

## Recommended Prompt Structure
1. Subject + action
2. Style and medium
3. Context (setting, lighting, time)
4. Visual layer (color palette, composition)
5. Technical layer (lens, DOF, film look)
6. Atmospheric layer (mood, story)

## Positive Examples
- "Luxury watch on black velvet, macro product photo, crisp highlights on brushed steel, low key lighting, 85mm lens"
- "Portrait of a chef in a warm kitchen, soft window light, shallow depth of field, subtle film grain"

## Negative Examples (What to Avoid)
- "Nice, beautiful, perfect" (non-visual adjectives)
- "No people, no text, no reflections" (replace with positive constraints)
- "Photo, illustration, oil, watercolor" (conflicting styles)

## Notes
- For complex scenes, build from a foundation prompt and add layers incrementally.
- If a detail matters, place it at the beginning.
