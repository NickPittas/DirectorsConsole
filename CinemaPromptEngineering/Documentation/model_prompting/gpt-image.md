## Official Guidance Highlights

- Detailed prompts perform better than minimal prompts.

## Recommended Prompt Structure
1. Subject + action
2. Scene and setting
3. Lighting and mood
4. Style or medium
5. Text in quotes with placement (if required)

## Positive Examples
- "Flat lay of a notebook and fountain pen, warm desk lamp light, muted tones, tidy composition."
