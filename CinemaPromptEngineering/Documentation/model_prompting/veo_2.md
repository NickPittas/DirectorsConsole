# Veo 2 Prompting Guide

Category: Video

## Official Guidance Highlights
- Use specific character details (appearance, action, dialogue).
- Build a world with light, texture, and atmosphere.
- Define visual style and tone early in the prompt.
- Describe sound explicitly to align audio with visuals.
- For complex action, spell out the play-by-play.

## Recommended Prompt Structure
1. Style and tone
2. Subject details + action
3. Environment and atmosphere
4. Camera framing and motion
5. Audio cues (optional)

## Positive Examples
- "Documentary style, a cartographer in a cluttered study, warm lamplight, medium shot, pages rustling and faint rain outside."
- "Cinematic off-road rally, handheld camera, muddy forest track, intense engine roar, one buggy splashes through a river then a truck follows through the spray."

## Negative Examples (What to Avoid)
- "Make it cinematic" (no specifics)
- "A bunch of things happen fast" (no clear action beats)
