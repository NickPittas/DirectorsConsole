# Midjourney Prompting Guide

Category: Image

## Official Guidance Highlights
- Prompts are plain language; short and simple prompts typically work best.
- Describe what you want, not what you do not want.
- Be specific with nouns, numbers, and key details.
- Use clear categories like subject, medium, environment, lighting, color, mood, and composition.
- Parameters are appended at the end of the prompt.

## Recommended Prompt Structure
1. Subject + action
2. Medium or style (photo, illustration, watercolor, etc.)
3. Environment + lighting
4. Mood + composition
5. Parameters (aspect ratio, etc.)

## Positive Examples
- "Three red foxes resting in tall grass, wildlife documentary photo, soft morning light, shallow depth of field, --ar 16:9"
- "Close-up portrait of a violinist, cinematic lighting, neutral background, quiet mood, --ar 2:3"

## Negative Examples (What to Avoid)
- "A scene with no people, not dark, not blurry, not noisy, not messy" (negations cause confusion)
- "cat, cat, cat, cat, cat, dog, dog, robot, spaceship, watercolor, oil, ink" (long unordered lists)

## Notes
- If a detail is critical, place it early in the prompt.
- If you need exclusions, use the no parameter rather than describing what you do not want.
