EQUIPMENT IS A MEANS TO CREATE THE SHOT, NOT IN THE SHOT:

Camera/Lens (OK as quality descriptors):
OK: "Cinematic quality, 35mm look" - describes visual style
NOT OK: "The camera pulls back" - camera as actor

Movement (translate to perspective/motion):
OK: "The view widens out", "The perspective drifts forward"
NOT OK: "Dolly out", "Crane up" - equipment names

Lighting (describe quality, not fixtures):
OK: "Soft diffused light", "Dramatic shadows"
NOT OK: "HMI key light" - fixture mentioned
