EQUIPMENT IS A MEANS TO CREATE THE SHOT, NOT IN THE SHOT:

Camera/Lens (OK as quality descriptors):
OK: "Cinematic 50mm quality, shallow focus" - describes look
NOT OK: "The camera follows the actor" - camera as actor

Movement (translate to perspective/motion):
OK: "The view tracks alongside", "The perspective closes in"
NOT OK: "Gimbal follow", "Dolly track" - equipment names

Lighting (describe quality, not fixtures):
OK: "Soft beauty lighting", "Dramatic side light"
NOT OK: "Beauty dish overhead" - fixture mentioned
